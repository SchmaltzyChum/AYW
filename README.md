# Pythonic App Example

This is a simple Pythonic App Example that demonstrates how to use Kivy, Pandas, and Plotly to create a simple user interface and plot some data.

## Installation of Packages

To run this app, you need to install the following packages:

- kivy
- pandas
- plotly
- kivy_garden

You can install them using pip. Open a terminal and run the following command:

pip install kivy pandas plotly kivy_garden


Note that some dependencies, such as Python itself or the Kivy's dependencies (e.g. Cython), may need to be installed separately. You can find more information in the Kivy documentation.

## Running the App

To run the app, navigate to the directory where the `pythonic_app_example.py` file is located and run the following command:

python pythonic_app_example.py


This will launch the app. You can interact with the UI and plot some data.

That's it! If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to contact me.
